    <h1>Ice Breaker</h1>
    <h2>Equilibrium</h2>
    <h2>Why are Glacers melting</h2>
    <p>The glacers are melting due to the way we as humans interact with the world. 
    When we go to produce anything from a factoer or go to drive our cars we release green house gasses into the atmosphere. 
    These greenhouse gasses heat up our atmosphere slowly melting the glacers as the world rises in temperature.</p>
    <h2>What can we do?</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>Contact your sitting officals about voting for pro-enviroment bills</ol>
        <ol>Use newer more energy effecient products</ol>
        <ol>Plant trees to help with deforestation</ol>
        <ol>Use altermate enegry when aplicable</ol>
        <ol>Ride a bike when possible :3</ol>
